# hand-me-down

This is a site for book lovers, created by book lovers. Exchange, sell or donate the books we no longer need. This site aims to help those in need by making second hand books for accessible and books overall a bit cheaper. This will also help people who have old book in their cupboards for years but don’t know what to do with it.

Our project includes the option for searching books. Search our huge collection for the book you want. You can search by Name of the Book, Author Name. Just click on the name of the seller and start chatting.

If the user cannot find the book they want to buy, we can always place a request on our site and connect with prospective sellers or donors. People, willing to do charity by buying books for the underprivileged, can look up the requested book list and the users who requested them. From there on they can contact that user through chat. 

Next is the main aspect of our project that is, donating or selling books. Users can donate your books to our database through our user-friendly site. We can also list your books for sale and interested buyers can contact you through our portal.

This website is in collaboration with **Nidhi Uppoor**.
For our website, we’ve used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, AJAX and SQL along with the Javascript libraries like jQuery, Scroll Reveal and CSS toolkit fontawesome.
